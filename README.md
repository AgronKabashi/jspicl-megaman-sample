# PICO-8 MegaMan
This is a sample project demonstrating how you can use [jspicl-cli](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/jspicl-cli) to build PICO-8 games with Javascript.

## Usage
```Shell
npm start
```

This will create a cartridge and automatically launch it in PICO-8. Whenever source files are changed, a rebuild will take place and reload PICO-8 with the updated cartridge for you.

```
npm run restore-cart
```

This will take the game.p8 cartridge in the project root and put it in the build directory for you.
**CAUTION**: This will overwrite any existing cartridge in the destination folder so make sure you do a backup first.

## Updating spritesheet
With jspicl-CLI you don't need to draw your sprites in PICO-8 anymore. Simply edit the spritesheet file, save and the cart will be reloaded with the new changes.
